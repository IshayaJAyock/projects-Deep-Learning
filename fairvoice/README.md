# FairVoice: Bias and Explainability in Speech Emotion Recognition

## 🎯 Project Overview

**FairVoice** is a groundbreaking research project that addresses critical ethical concerns in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems. As SER technologies become increasingly deployed in healthcare, education, and customer support applications, evidence reveals that these systems often exhibit systematic biases across gender, accent, and ethnicity, leading to inconsistent and potentially unfair emotional predictions.

This project pioneers the development of fair, interpretable, and trustworthy emotion recognition models that not only achieve high accuracy but also behave equitably across diverse demographic groups. Through comprehensive bias assessment, advanced mitigation strategies, and explainability analysis, FairVoice contributes to building more ethical and transparent AI systems for speech processing.

## 🌟 Key Innovations

- **Comprehensive Bias Assessment**: Multi-dimensional analysis across gender, ethnicity, and accent
- **Advanced Mitigation Strategies**: Data balancing, adversarial debiasing, and reweighting techniques
- **Explainable AI Integration**: SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME for spectrogram interpretation
- **Fairness-Accuracy Trade-off Analysis**: Quantified understanding of fairness interventions
- **Reproducible Benchmarks**: Transparent, ethically sound evaluation protocols

## 📋 Project Goals

1. **Assess bias and fairness** in standard SER models across speaker demographics
2. **Implement bias mitigation strategies** including data balancing, adversarial debiasing, and reweighting
3. **Integrate explainability tools** (SHAP, Grad-CAM, LIME) to interpret model behavior
4. **Quantify the trade-off** between fairness and accuracy
5. **Produce transparent, reproducible, and ethically sound SER benchmarks**
